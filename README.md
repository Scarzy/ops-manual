# Introduction

This manual serves as the primary means for the Student Robotics Trustees to define what Student Robotics is, what it stands for and how it operates. It is not intended as a detailed prescriptive manual of how each activity within the organisation is carried out, but rather as a means to set the foundations upon which the organisation is built.
