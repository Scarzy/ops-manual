# Change Log

{% hint style="info" %}
Each release of the Operations Manual has an entry on this page. Within this entry changes are broken down into 'Added', 'Changed', 'Removed' and 'Minor Fixes'. The first three categories cover modifications that affect the function of the document, whereas the last one includes modifications that do not, for example corrections to typos and formatting. Each entry also includes the date on which it took effect.

## Version WIP \(work-in-progress\)

### Added

### Changed

### Removed

### Minor Fixes

## Version 3 \(2018-07-09\)

The whole Operations Manual has been completely rewritten and bears little resemblance to Version 2, therefore it would not be sensible to try and enumerate all of the changes. Version 3 effectively represents a completely new direction for the Operations Manual and should be viewed as a completely new work.
