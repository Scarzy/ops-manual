# DBS Checks

DBS checks, formerly known as CRB checks, are where a persons records are checked to identify past criminal activity, which may present issues for another role.

## Types of check

There are various levels of DBS check;
* Basic check,
* Standard check,
* Enhanced check,
* Enhanced check with barred lists.

Different roles may require different levels of check.

For most roles within Student Robotics, a DBS check is not required?

## DBS Checks from other roles
If you have a DBS check for another organisation, it may or may not be possible to consider it for use with Student Robotics.
Please contact the Safeguarding Co-ordinator to see if this applies.
