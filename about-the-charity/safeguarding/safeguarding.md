# Safeguarding

Everyone has a responsibility to keep children and young people safe. All organisations that come into contact with children should have specific safeguarding policies and procedures in place. This includes voluntary and community organisations, faith groups, private sector providers, as well as schools, hospitals and sports clubs \(NSPCC, 2018\).

Student Robotics takes child safeguarding very seriously. It is important that young people have the opportunity to participate in competitions and other events in a safe environment.

All young people that a Student Robotics volunteer is working with must be supervised by a responsible adult; this will either be a parent or a teacher who will have overall responsibility for that young person.

Everyone who volunteers with Student Robotics is bound by a [code of conduct ](code-of-conduct.md)that provides a clear expectation of how they will work with others, including competitors and other volunteers.

Student Robotics encourages anyone who is involved in working with young people who are participating in Student Robotics activities to report any safeguarding concerns as soon as possible to the Safeguarding Co-ordinator via [safeguarding@studentrobotics.org](mailto:safeguarding@studentrobotics.org).

There are 2 aspects to safeguarding that affect Student Robotics events; the protection of the young people, and the protection of SR volunteers against lawsuits and criminal charges.

Volunteers need to be mindful of actions that may seem completely innocent, but expose themselves to larger consequences.

* Avoid being in 1-to-1 situations with young people, should you find yourself in such a situation unintentionally then try to move to somewhere where someone else is within sight and hearing. This is important not only to protect the young person from any inappropriate acts, but also to ensure that should an allegation be made there are witnesses to cooberate the volunteers
* The above also applies to contact online via e-mail, social media, etc.
* Having a personal relationship with a young person.
* Respect everyone's right to personal privacy.
* Act within appropriate boundaries, even in difficult situations.

## 1-to-1 situations
Volunteers involved in Student Robotics events should avoid 1-to-1 situations involving young people.

This is necessary both to protect young people from inappropriate situations, but also to protect volunteers should an action be misinterpretted or an allegation made.
It ensures there is always a witness

1-to-1 situations should never be planned.
Should an unexpected 1-to-1 situation occur, volunteers should attempt to bring another

## Relationships
Personal relationships with young people are not appropriate, either as a friendship or a partner.
Even if everyone is of a sufficiently legal age, the fact volunteers are in a position of trust makes them inappropriate.
As a number of the volunteers are previous competitors, it is understood that they may already have existing friendships or relationships with young people.
Obviously, volunteers are not expected to end these relationships in order to volunteer, however volunteers should be mindful about how these relationships may appear to others.

## Duty of care
As an organisation Student Robotics has a duty of care over all people who attend the events.
A duty of care is created when a dangerous situation is created.

An example of how this might occur outside of normal event risk assessments is when a young person arrives at an event without a responsible adult.
The young person cannot take part in the event as Student Robotics does not take responsibility for the young people, however the young person also cannot just leave the event.
Should the young person be asked or allowed to leave unaccompanied, this would create a potential dangerous situation in which they come to harm before they reach their responsible adult.
In such a situation an attempt should be made to contact the responsible adult, and confirm if they are on their way, or how to get the young person home.
If this fails, the young persons parents should be contacted.
It is appropriate to use the young persons phone to do this, however the conversation should be had by a volunteer to be sure the responsible adult or parents approve.

## Reporting incidents
Student Robotics encourages anyone who is involved in working with young people who are participating in Student Robotics activities to report any safeguarding concerns as soon as possible to the Safeguarding Co-ordinator via [safeguarding@studentrobotics.org](mailto:safeguarding@studentrobotics.org).

Should a concern need immediate attention, it may be prudent to contact the Safeguarding Co-ordinator in person or via phone. In these circumstances the Event Co-ordinator and the Trustees will have the necessary contact details.

When reporting a concern, the following information should be included;
* Your contact information
* Names \(real, nicknames, or pseudonyms\) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
* Your account of what occured, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.
* Any available record of what occurred.
* Any additional information that may be helpful.

Details should be as accurate as possible, word for word if possible.

## Protecting volunteers/young people
The safety of all involved in Student Robotics events is of prime importance to Student Robotics.
As such, Student Robotics will always act to support anyone involved in a safeguarding incident, be it the young people involved, the person who reported the concern, or the volunteer involved.
