# Safeguarding

Everyone has a responsibility to keep children and young people safe. All organisations that come into contact with children should have specific safeguarding policies and procedures in place. This includes voluntary and community organisations, faith groups, private sector providers, as well as schools, hospitals and sports clubs \(NSPCC, 2018\).

Student Robotics takes child safeguarding very seriously. It is important that young people have the opportunity to participate in competitions and other events in a safe environment.

All young people that a Student Robotics volunteer is working with must be supervised by a responsible adult; this will either be a parent or a teacher who will have overall responsibility for that young person.

Volunteers must never meet with young people who are participating in Student Robotics activities outside of the supervised environment or communicate over a channel other than that officially set up for group communications.

Student Robotics encourages anyone who is involved in working with young people who are participating in Student Robotics activities to report any safeguarding concerns to the Trustees via [trustees@studentrobotics.org](mailto:trustees@studentrobotics.org).
