# Annual Robotics Competition

The Student Robotics Competition Programme is the main activity of Student Robotics and is how it currently meets its charitable objective set out in its [constitution](https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual/tree/d76377192d4c94c4bd4298f0f3954f5d342af24b/resources/constitution.pdf). It consists of an annual programme, aligned with the academic year, where teams of 16-19 year-olds \(generally in sixth form\) partake in an reasonably open-ended engineering challenge to construct autonomous robots.

The planning, management and running of the Competition Programme is the remit of the Competition Programme Team  and it is up to the Competition Programme Committee \(with guidance from the Trustees\) to define what the programme will be for a given annual cycle. The Competition Programme Team is supported by the Kit Team.
