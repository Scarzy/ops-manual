# Annual Robotics Competition

The Student Robotics Competition Programme is the main activity of Student Robotics and is how it currently meets its charitable objective set out in its [constitution](https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual/tree/d76377192d4c94c4bd4298f0f3954f5d342af24b/resources/constitution.pdf). It consists of an annual programme, aligned with the academic year, where teams of 16-19 year-olds \(generally in sixth form\) take part in an reasonably open-ended engineering challenge to construct autonomous robots.

The planning, management and delivery of the competition programme is the remit of the [Competition Team](competition-team.md)  and it is up to the Competition Team Committee \(with guidance from the Trustees\) to define the programme for a given annual cycle. The Competition  Team is supported by the [Kit Team](kit-team.md).
