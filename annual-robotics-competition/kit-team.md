# Kit Team

This page describes the structure, function and purpose of a sub-section of the Student Robotics organisation called the Kit Team. The purpose of the Kit Team is to oversee and manage the development, maintenance and support of the Student Robotics Kit \('the Kit'\) for the purpose of running an annual robotics competition.

## Structure

The Kit Team is a group of volunteers that provide a Kit service to the Student Robotics Competition Team. The Kit Team is lead by a Committee that is responsible for fulfilling the aims of the Kit Team.

Volunteers apply through the Kit Team Committee to join the Kit Team. The Committee will ensure the team has an appropriate balance of relevant skills. The Kit Team is separate from the Competition Team. It is expected that Kit Team volunteers will have previously volunteered with the competition team and that volunteers from both teams will be available to help run the annual competition.

## The Kit Team Committee

The Kit Team is lead and organised by the [Kit Team Committee](https://github.com/srobo/kit-team-proposal/blob/9b6d846f1a641dd72c652475780f1f14bd84e325/README.md#The-Kit-Team-Committee) \(the Committee\). The Committee develops and clearly communicates a strategic vision, coherent with the [values of Student Robotics](https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual/blob/master/about-the-charity/vision-mission-and-values.md), for the Kit. The Committee ensures that resources are always used in the best interests of the charity.

The Committee delegates responsibilities and resources to the rest of the Kit Team.

Members join the committee by application to the Trustees. The Committee will operate on a continuous/rolling timeline. Each member has a maximum term of two years, after which they are automatically retired from the Committee. Before the conclusion of the two year term the member may apply to the Trustees to extend their term for a further two years - without a gap in membership of the Committee.

The committee is a group of 3 - 5 people, and must have at least the following roles:

* Chairperson
  * Convene, and chair, meetings of the Committee
* Secretary
  * Ensure that minutes of Kit Team meetings are taken and made available to the Trustees and other members of the Kit Team.
  * Provide reports to Trustees \(see [Accountability](https://github.com/srobo/kit-team-proposal/blob/9b6d846f1a641dd72c652475780f1f14bd84e325/README.md#Accountability)\)
* Treasurer
  * Prepare and manage the budget, including seeking approval from the Trustees.
  * Keep financial records \(in a form to be agreed with the Trustees\).
  * Understand and follow the requirements defined in the [Money Matters](https://srobo.gitbook.io/ops-manual/annual-robotics-competition/money-matters) section.

Upon formation, the Committee should self-organise to elect these roles within the group, along with any other roles that they deem necessary, e.g. Software Coordinator.

## Responsibilities

The Kit Team is responsible for providing the Kit Service to the core team in order to enable the competition.

The Kit Service includes, but is not limited to:

* Provision of sufficient working Kit to meet the needs of the Competition Team
* Recovering and checking Kit following a competition cycle
* Storing the Kit safely
* Maintaining an inventory of the Kit
* Development of Kit
* Maintenance of Kit \(both during and outside of the competition cycle\)
* Manufacture/purchasing of Kit
* Technical documentation for competitors and for volunteers
* Technical support to competitors and volunteers \(both remote and in-person at events\)

The Kit Team Committee is responsible for:

* Communicating a strategic vision for the Kit.
* Ensuring that resources are deployed only for the purposes of delivering the Student Robotics Competition or as directed by the Trustees from time to time.
* Maintaining a record of Kit Team members, with their abilities and desired workload.
* The management, tracking and distribution of assets within the Kit Team.
* The management of the workload of members of the Kit Team.
* Ensuring projects are open source, open to contribution from external parties, and inviting to work on by volunteers.
* Assigning and managing projects/maintenance to team members, this may be assigned to self organising subgroups of individuals.
* Communicating with the Competition Team Committee to ensure successful delivery of the annual competition.

In addition to the above specific responsibilities, the Committee and Team are also expected to:

* Agree to uphold [Vision, Mission and Values](https://opsmanual.studentrobotics.org/about-the-charity/vision-mission-and-values).
* Operate within the framework defined in this operations manual.
* Abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://opsmanual.studentrobotics.org/about-the-charity/code-of-conduct).

## Definitions

Kit: The hardware and software \(including software services\) that are provided to teams to enable them to take part in the annual robotics competition.

## Accountability

The Kit Team works directly under the Trustees. A report will be delivered to the Trustees every 4 months to update them on the work of the Team and state of the Kit.

Minutes of meetings should be made available to the general public although access to any sensitive commercial data, may be restricted to the Trustees.

## Budget

Specific budgeting will be managed on a case by case basis, applying for budget from the Trustees in each of these cases.

If deemed necessary a "Development Pot" could be made available to cover low-cost resources used in the development process.
