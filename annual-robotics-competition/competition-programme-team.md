# Competition Programme Team

This page describes the structure, function and purpose of the Competition Programme Team \('the Team'\). The Team is lead and organised by the Competition Programme Committee \('the Committee'\). The purpose of the Team and its Committee is to define and deliver the Competition Programme for a single competition cycle \(1 year\). The Committee are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Competition Programme is delivered to the standard expected by the Trustees. The Team \(and its Committee\) operates on an 11-month cycle \(see [Formation and Dissolution](competition-programme-team.md#formation) below\).

{% hint style="info" %}
For the SR2019 competition cycle \(July 2018 to June 2019\) the Competition Programme Team/Committee was known as the Core Team. It was renamed and split up for the following competition cycle to more clearly denote its purpose within the organisation and to encourage wider participation.
{% endhint %}

## Structure

The Team is a group of volunteers who work together to deliver a single Competition Programme. Members of the Team work closely with other teams within SR and third parties in order to deliver the Competition Programme.

Volunteers ask the Committee to join the Team. The Committee should not unreasonably restrict membership of the Team, but should ensure that the volunteer is not already a member of another team within SR \(see [FAQ: Why can I only be in one team within SR?](competition-programme-team.md#why-can-i-only-be-in-one-team-within-sr)\).

## The Competition Programme Committee

The Team is lead by a Committee. The Committee is a group of 3-5 people who are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Competition Programme is delivered to the standard expected by the Trustees. The Committee is accountable to the Trustees.

It is of vital importance to understand that the Committee serves a management and organisation role within the Team. They are strongly advised to not directly carry out the tasks required to deliver a competition; the Trustees will help to ensure that this is the case throughout the year. The Committee must focus on management of time, resources and volunteers within the Team. They should provide support and guidance to Team members to allow them to be as effective as possible in delivering the competition.

## Formation and Dissolution

The Team and its Committee operate on a 11-month cycle running from early July to early June the following year. The one month gap is enforced for two reasons:

1. It provides a much-needed break for members of the Team and Committee. Delivering a competition is a huge undertaking and can require a significant investment of time and effort from volunteers \(although this should be kept under control by the Committee\). The month's break removes all responsibilities and sense of duty to perform tasks from all members of the Team and Committee and is akin to the Formula 1 summer break.
2. It provides an opportunity for new volunteers to get involved in delivering a competition starting from the same place as the rest of the Team. There is nothing to stop volunteers joining the Team during the 11-month period, but it can be beneficial to be around from the start. Having a gap provides a definite start of a new cycle.

Around early July a new Committee is formed. Once formed, the Committee then assembles the Team that they will work with to deliver the competition over the follwing 11 months.

### Registration of Interest

Approximately three weeks before the Committee is to be formed all registered Student Robotics volunteers are contacted to invite them to register an interest in being part of the next Committee or Team. Previous members of the Committee and/or Team are welcome to register interest. The Committee must have between 3 and 5 members. If more than 5 volunteers register an interest in being on the Committee they will all be invited to the formation meeting, however only 5 of them will be allowed to become Committee members. If more than 10 volunteers register an interest in being on the Committee then the Trustees will select a short-list of 10 volunteers to invite to the formation meeting based on the skills and experience they could bring to the Committee. Any volunteers who registered an interest in being on the Committee but were not selected will be contacted in the future if vacancies appear on the Committee during the 11-month period.

### Formation

The Committee is formed at the start of the annual competition cycle, around early July. This happens during a physical meeting \(travel expenses to/from the meeting will be reimbursed\). At the meeting the Trustees will discuss their expectations of the Committee, what the Committee can expect from the Trustees and will endeavour to ensure that the responsibilities they would be taking on are clear. After discussing these points, and answering any questions, the Trustees will ask for a show of hands of people who would like to join the Committee. There is absolutely no pressure to join the Committee if one feels that they cannot commit themselves. If more than 5 people indicate a desire to join the Committee at this stage the Trustees will select the 5 people that they feel are most able to take on the responsibilities of the Committee based on the earlier discussion.

Once the Committee is formed the Trustees will outline their expectations for the Competition Programme. Each year the Trustees will provide guidance to the new Committee as to the direction in which they would like to the Competition Programme to be taken and where they would like the Committee to focus their efforts. For example it may be the case that the Trustees would like to expand the number of Teams, or they may want the Committee to focus on increasing volunteer engagement during this competition cycle.

### Initial Committee Tasks

After the conclusion of the formation meeting the newly formed Committee has two initial tasks to complete. Both of these should be completed within 2 weeks of the formation meeting.

1. **Recruitment of a Team.** The Trustees will provide the Committee with the details of volunteers who registered an interest in being on the Team during the [Registration of Interest](competition-programme-team.md#registration-of-interest) phase. The Committee should contact these volunteers to see if they are still interested and to make sure that they understand the purpose of the Competition Programme Team that they are looking to join. If they do still want to join the Team, the Committee must make it clear to them that they have joined and maintain a record of Team members. The Committee may also contact all volunteers throughout the 11-month period to recruit more members into the Team.
2. **High level planning session.** Hold a full-day session \(in person\) to prepare a high level plan for the coming competition cycle. To give a sense of scale, it is expected that this high level plan will take the form of no more than 2 A4 pages and should include time and resource estimates \(both volunteers and assets\). Also during this session the Committee must divide up the [key responsibilities](competition-programme-team.md#key-responsibilities) between them \(each responsibility must be taken by a single Committee member, each Committee member may take on multiple responsibilities\). The Committee must report their division of responsibilties to the Trustees.

### Dissolution

At the end of the annual competition cycle, around early June, the Committee is expected to meet with the Trustees to review the previous Competition Programme. This serves as a useful event for both the Committee to reflect on their achievements and the Trustees to gather as much information as possible to feed into the next competition cycle. After this meeting the Committee and the Team that it managed is effectively disbanded. There is approximately a one month gap until the Committee is next reconvened, allowing everyone to take a break. As mentioned above, previous Committee/Team members are very welcome to register their interest in being Committee/Team members the following year.

#### Review Questions

During the dissolution meeting the Committee will be asked, among other things, to answer the following questions. It may be helpful to consider these questions before the meeting:

1. Did the Committee and Team function well?
2. Was the Committee the right size?
3. Did everyone on the Team \(including the Committee\) have enough to do?
4. Did anyone have too much to do?
5. Were there tasks which no-one wanted to do?
6. What can we do to improve the diversity in the Team?
7. Were there activities the Team wanted to do but were unable to, and why?
8. Did the Trustees do enough to support the Committee?
9. How do members of the Committee see Student Robotics developing and expanding?

## FAQs

### Why can I only be in one team within SR?

Unfortunately SR has a history of relying too much on a small number of individuals. This can easily lead to those individuals feeling overworked and overwhelmed. Limiting membership to a single team within SR at a time is to protect you from the risk of becoming overworked and overwhelmed. One of the key responsibilities of the Committee is to ensure that Team members are happy and feel comfortable with the workload they have within the Team; if a volunteer is part of multiple teams it is very difficult for this oversight to be adequately provided.

### Why is there an upper limit on the size of the Committee?

The Committee is intentionally limited to a maximum of 5 members for two reasons:

1. To ensure that they do not get the impression that they could fulfil their responsibility to deliver a competition alone.
2. To operate efficiently and have good communication between members. All members of the Committee need to have an awareness of the current state of things and having a small group make this significantly easier and more efficient.

The limit of 5 members was chosen based on feedback from the Core Team that ran SR2019. Multiple Core Team members indicated that they thought a smaller Core Team \(now the Committee\) would operate more effectively.
